# 🚀 Feather Wand - JMeter Agent

This plugin provides a simple way to chat with AI in JMeter. Feather Wand serves as your intelligent assistant for JMeter test plan development, optimization, and troubleshooting.

> 🪄 **About the name**: The name "Feather Wand" was suggested by my children who were inspired by an episode of the animated show Bluey. In the episode, a simple feather becomes a magical wand that transforms the ordinary into something special (heavy) - much like how this plugin aims to transform your JMeter experience with a touch of AI magic!

The prompts `claude.system.prompt`, `openai.system.prompt`, and `bedrock.system.prompt` can be configured separately in the properties file. The default prompts are designed to provide helpful, JMeter-specific responses tailored to each AI service's capabilities.

## 🔍 Special Commands

### 📊 @usage Command

Use the `@usage` command to view detailed token usage information for your AI interactions:

1. **How to Use**:

   - Simply type `@usage` in the chat
   - The command will show usage statistics for OpenAI, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock depending on which service you're using

2. **Information Provided**:

   - Overall summary of total conversations and tokens used
   - Detailed breakdown of recent conversations (last 10)
   - Token usage per conversation (input and output tokens)
   - Timestamps and model information
   - Link to official pricing pages for cost information

3. **Example Output**:

   ```
   # Usage Summary

   ## Overall Summary
   - Total Conversations: 5
   - Total Input Tokens: 1500
   - Total Output Tokens: 2000
   - Total Tokens: 3500

   ## Recent Conversations
   - Conversation 1: 300 input, 400 output tokens
   - Conversation 2: 250 input, 350 output tokens
   ...
   ```

4. **Benefits**:
   - Track your API usage and costs
   - Monitor token consumption patterns
   - Identify potential optimization opportunities
   - Keep track of conversation history

### 🪄 @this Command

Use the `@this` command in your message to get detailed information about the currently selected element in your test plan. For example:

- "Tell me about @this element"
- "How can I optimize @this?"
- "What are the best practices for @this?"

Feather Wand will analyze the selected element and provide tailored information and advice.

### 🔧 @optimize Command

Use the `@optimize` command (or simply type "optimize") to get optimization recommendations for the currently selected element in your test plan. This command will:

1. Analyze the selected element's configuration
2. Identify potential performance bottlenecks
3. Suggest specific, actionable improvements
4. Provide best practices for that element type

For example, if you have an HTTP Request sampler selected, the optimization recommendations might include:

- Connection and timeout settings adjustments
- Proper header management
- Efficient parameter handling
- Encoding settings optimization
- Redirect handling improvements

Simply select an element in your test plan and type `@optimize` or `optimize` in the chat to receive tailored optimization recommendations.

### 🧹 @lint Command

Use the `@lint` command to automatically rename elements in your test plan for better organization and readability:

1. **How to Use**:

   - Type `@lint` in the chat to analyze your test plan structure
   - The AI will suggest better names for elements based on their function and context
   - Review the suggestions and confirm to apply the changes
   - Use the undo/redo buttons to revert or reapply changes if needed
   - e.g. `@lint rename the elements based on the URL` or `@lint rename the elements in pascal case`

2. **Benefits**:

   - Improves test plan readability and maintenance
   - Applies consistent naming conventions across your test plan
   - Helps identify elements with generic or unclear names
   - Makes test plans more understandable for team members
   - Undo it if you don't like the changes
   - Redo it if you like the changes

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Run `@lint` after creating a new test plan to establish good naming from the start
   - Use it before sharing test plans with team members
   - Apply it to imported test plans to make them conform to your naming standards

This feature is particularly valuable for large test plans or when working in teams where consistent naming is essential for collaboration.

### 📦 @wrap Command

Use the `@wrap` command to intelligently group HTTP samplers under Transaction Controllers for better organization and reporting:

1. **How to Use**:

   - Select a Thread Group in your test plan
   - Type `@wrap` in the chat
   - The AI will analyze your HTTP samplers and group similar ones under Transaction Controllers
   - Use the undo button to revert changes if needed

2. **Benefits**:

   - Improves test plan organization and readability
   - Enhances test reports with meaningful transaction metrics
   - Groups related HTTP requests logically
   - Preserves the original order and hierarchy of samplers
   - Maintains all child elements (like assertions and post-processors) with their parent samplers

3. **How It Works**:
   - Analyzes sampler names and paths to identify logical groupings
   - Creates appropriately named Transaction Controllers
   - Moves samplers under their respective Transaction Controllers
   - Preserves the original order and hierarchy
   - Uses pattern matching and structural analysis (not AI) for its grouping logic

This feature is especially useful for imported or recorded test plans that contain many individual HTTP samplers without proper organization.

## 🗝️ API Configuration

Feather Wand supports Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock APIs. You can configure any of these services in your properties file.

### Anthropic API (Claude)

1. Go to [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/) website
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key and paste it into the `anthropic.api.key` property in your `jmeter.properties` file
5. For more information about the API key, visit the [API Key documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/api)

### OpenAI API

1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) website
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key and paste it into the `openai.api.key` property in your `jmeter.properties` file
5. For more information about the API key, visit the [API Key documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

### AWS Bedrock API

1. **Set up AWS Account and IAM Permissions**:
   - Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Create an IAM user with programmatic access
   - Attach the `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy to the user (or create a custom policy with Bedrock permissions)
   - Note down the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

2. **Enable Bedrock Model Access**:
   - Go to the AWS Bedrock console in your preferred region
   - Navigate to "Model access" in the left sidebar
   - Request access to Claude models (anthropic.claude-3-sonnet, anthropic.claude-3-haiku, etc.)
   - Wait for approval (this may take a few minutes to hours depending on the model)

3. **Configure Credentials**:
   - Copy your AWS Access Key ID and paste it into the `bedrock.access.key` property
   - Copy your AWS Secret Access Key and paste it into the `bedrock.secret.key` property
   - Set the `bedrock.region` property to the AWS region where you have Bedrock access (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`)

4. **Important Notes**:
   - AWS Bedrock is only available in specific regions. Check [AWS Bedrock availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html#bedrock-regions) for the latest region list
   - Model availability varies by region. Ensure Claude models are available in your chosen region
   - For production use, consider using IAM roles instead of access keys for enhanced security
   - Monitor your usage through AWS CloudWatch and AWS Cost Explorer

### Model Selection

Feather Wand automatically filters available models to show only chat-compatible models. By default, it excludes audio, TTS, transcription, and other non-chat models. You can select your preferred model from the dropdown in the UI, or set default models in the properties file:

- For Claude: `claude.default.model` (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)
- For OpenAI: `openai.default.model` (e.g., `gpt-4o`)
- For AWS Bedrock: `bedrock.model` (e.g., `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`)

### Model Filtering

Feather Wand applies intelligent filtering to the available models to ensure you only see relevant chat models in the dropdown:

- **OpenAI Models**: Filters out audio, TTS, whisper, davinci, search, transcribe, realtime, and instruct models to show only GPT chat models.
- **Claude Models**: Shows only the latest available Claude models.
- **AWS Bedrock Models**: Shows available Claude models through Bedrock, including:
  - `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` (Recommended for balanced performance)
  - `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` (Fastest, cost-effective)
  - `anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0` (Most capable, higher cost)
  - `anthropic.claude-instant-v1` (Legacy, fast responses)
  - `anthropic.claude-v2:1` and `anthropic.claude-v2` (Legacy versions)

This filtering ensures that you only see models that are compatible with the chat interface and appropriate for JMeter-related tasks.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer and Best Practices

While the Feather Wand plugin aims to provide helpful assistance, please keep the following in mind:

- **AI Limitations**: The AI can make mistakes or provide incorrect information. Always verify critical suggestions before implementing them in production tests.
- **Backup Your Test Plans**: Always backup your test plans before making significant changes, especially when implementing AI suggestions.
- **Test Verification**: After making changes based on AI recommendations, thoroughly verify your test plan functionality in a controlled environment before running it against production systems.
- **Performance Impact**: Some AI-suggested configurations may impact test performance. Monitor resource usage when implementing new configurations.
- **Security Considerations**: Do not share sensitive information (credentials, proprietary code, etc.) in your conversations with the AI.
- **API Costs**: Be aware that using Claude API, OpenAI API, or AWS Bedrock incurs costs based on token usage. The plugin is designed to minimize token usage, but excessive use may result in higher costs. AWS Bedrock may offer different pricing models and potentially lower costs compared to direct API access.

This plugin is provided as a tool to assist JMeter users, but the ultimate responsibility for test plan design, implementation, and execution remains with the user.
